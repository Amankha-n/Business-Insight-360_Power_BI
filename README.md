## Company Background
AtliQ Hardware is a rapidly expanding company that has established its presence globally. Specializing in the sale of computers and computer accessories, AtliQ operates through three primary channels:
- Retailers
- Direct Sales
- Distributors

The company recently encountered a significant loss after opening a store in America, relying on surveys, intuition, and Excel analysis. This setback, combined with strong competition from companies with advanced analytics teams, led AtliQ Hardware to develop its own analytics capabilities to enable data-driven decisions and secure a competitive edge in the industry.

## Project Overview
To address the challenges and leverage opportunities, AtliQ Hardware initiated a project to implement data analytics using Power BI. The project is designed to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain, helping them to make informed decisions and stay ahead in the market.

This project was developed by following a structured approach based on a widely recognized Power BI course.
